## Merge

## Challenge
Create a function that sorts an array using merge sort.

Review the pseudocode below, then trace the algorithm by stepping through the process with the provided sample array. Document your explanation by creating a blog article that shows the step-by-step output after each iteration through some sort of visual.

Once you are done with your article, code a working, tested implementation of Insertion Sort based on the pseudocode provided.

## Approach & Efficiency

Big O:
Time: O(n log n) 
Space: O(n)
