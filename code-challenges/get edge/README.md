# Graph Get Edge

## Challenge
Write a function which takes in a graph, and an array of city names. Return whether the full trip is possible with direct flights, and how much it would cost.

## Approach & Efficiency
Create addNode() to create each city, and addEdge() to connect each city with a flight that includes a dollar amount. 
Create getNeighbor() to find cities that have direct flights amount them and show the dollar amount too. If there is no direct flight between two cities, it will show 0. 

Big O:
Time: O(n) 
Space: O(n)
