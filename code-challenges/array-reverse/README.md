#Reverse an Array

## Challenge
Takes an array as an argument, and return an array with elements in reversed order.

## Approach & Efficiency
Swapping the first and last element, then the second and second-to-last element, then the third and third-to-last element, etc until the i is no longer less than than j.

Big O:
Time: O(n)
Space: O(1)
